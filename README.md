# End-to-End Power BI Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project leverages Power BI to analyze and visualize sales performance across various dimensions such as continent, year, and category. The goal is to provide actionable insights to drive business decisions and optimize sales strategies.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Raw sales data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor to ensure data quality and consistency.
- **Data Modeling**: Relationships between datasets were created, hierarchies built, and DAX formulas applied to derive meaningful metrics such as sales, target comparisons, and performance ratios.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Multiple interactive visuals were developed to represent key trends and insights.

## Main Dashboard Components
- **Total Sales & Target**: Displays total sales against the sales target for quick performance tracking.
- **Sales Performance Over Year**: Shows how sales have progressed over time, offering a clear view of trends.
- **Sales by Continent**: A visual breakdown of total sales by continent to understand regional performance.
  - **Tooltip**: Hovering over the pie chart provides additional insights into sales by territory.
- **Margin % by Category**: Displays margin percentages for different product categories.
-  **filters** for continent and year, allowing users to drill down further into specific regions and timeframes.

## Key Visualizations
1. **Main Overview Dashboard**: This dashboard brings together total sales, targets, and performance metrics, offering an all-in-one view of the business's sales status.
2. **Sales by Territory**: A bar chart that provides insights into sales distribution by territory, accessible through the tooltip of pie chart on the main dashboard.
3. **Margin by Category**: A focused analysis of margin percentages by category,
4.  **Slicers** for filtering by continent and year.
